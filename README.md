# Happy Birthday Jordine

Hey Jordine! Sorry about forgetting to get you a card for your 20th Birthday, even if I wasn't with you at the time, I definitely should have sent one, a gift isn't enough. I know it's like 3 months late, but I hope this little doodad brings a smile to your face! It was pretty fun to work on, and If you like I can teach you how to do some of the stuff in it! (`Join the nerd side`).

Anyway, Thanks for putting up with me for like 2 years now, I love you!

## How to Open your Card

So like usually this kinda thing doesn't need instructions but I think my card is a little special.

- You have to go over to the top right of the GitHub page (https://github.com/leeandher/Happy-Birthday-Jordine)
- Then click the green button '**Clone or download**' and then click **Download ZIP**.
- Now unzip the folder and navigate to `./happy/birthday/jordine.html`
- Open up `jordine.html` in your browser!

And enjoy! Happy Birthday Jay!

## How to Read your Card

Again I know this is super lame and weird but just letting you know, how to read the card!

- Use the right arrow key, the down arrow key, the 'D' key, or click the right side of the screen to go forward
- Use the left arrow key, the up arrow key, the 'A' key, or click the left side of the scree to go backward

And that's it!

## Dev Stuff

In case you want to get your hands dirty with making your own one of these guys, here are your steps. They're a bit complicated.

- Download `npm/node` over [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
- Open up your terminal once its done (Win, 'cmd')
- Use `ls` and `cd [folder-name]` to get to your unzipped copy of this stuff
- Type `npm install` in the terminal (when you're in this folder)
- Then type `npm start`, it should open up a browser
- Now you can go into the `./dev` folder and make changes to the following to change the card!
  - `aesthetics.scss`
  - `iloveevery.pug`
- It'll automatically refresh the page when you make a change now, Happy coding!
